## Local testing

```bash
# Terminal 1 — server
JAMENDO_CLIENT_ID=your_key go run ./cmd/tavrn

# Terminal 2 — client with audio
go run ./cmd/tavrn-client --dev

# Or bare SSH without audio
ssh localhost -p 2222
```

The `--dev` flag connects the client to `localhost:2222` instead of the production server.

## Branch workflow

```
feature/* ──PR──> dev ──merge──> main (deploy)
```

| Branch | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `main` | Production. Runs on the VPS. |
| `dev` | All development. PRs target here. |
| `feature/*` | Short-lived feature branches created from dev. |

1. Create a feature branch from `dev`
2. Open a PR targeting `dev`
3. Test locally with `--dev`
4. When dev is stable, merge to `main` during planned downtime

## Architecture

**Server** — Wish-based SSH server. Each connection gets a Bubble Tea TUI. A shared hub broadcasts messages between sessions. The jukebox engine manages track playback state (current track, requests, votes, phase transitions).

**Audio streaming** — The server registers a `tavrn-audio` SSH channel type. When the client binary connects, it opens two channels: `session` (TUI) and `tavrn-audio` (MP3 stream). The streamer downloads tracks from Jamendo, buffers them, and sends them to connected audio channels using a length-prefixed wire protocol.

**Client binary** — Custom SSH client that opens both channels. Pipes MP3 data to a headless mpv subprocess for playback. Late-joining clients receive audio from the current playback position.

**Wire protocol** — Per track: `[4-byte header len][JSON metadata][4-byte audio len][MP3 bytes]`.

## Admin commands

```bash
# Send banner to all connected users (server-side only)
./tavrn --message "Maintenance in 10 minutes"

# Purge all data
./tavrn purge
```

## Tests

```bash
go test ./...
