A terminal tavern over SSH.

Chat, listen to music, and hang out with strangers — right from your terminal.

No signup. No account. Your SSH key is your identity.

Everything resets weekly. Nothing is permanent.

### Quick connect

Chat, gallery, genre radio — no install needed.

```
ssh tavrn.sh
```

### Full experience

Same as above, plus music through your speakers.

```
go install tavrn.sh/cmd/tavrn@latest
tavrn
```

Requires [mpv](https://mpv.io/) for audio playback.
The binary checks on launch and tells you how to install it.

### What's inside

**Rooms** — Hang out in the lounge, post notes on the gallery board, or leave ideas in suggestions.
